# task-manager

Fancy task managers with slick user interfaces are slow and cumbersome. Now that you have the power of the command line at your disposal, you would like be able to access all your tasks without having to burden yourself with tedious pointing and clicking. For this task manager project, I design an object oriented task manager application that will allow you to enter tasks, save them to a file, and retrieve them...all without moving your hands from the keyboard
